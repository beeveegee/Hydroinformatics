Conceptual Data Model

A group of researchers recently deployed several instruments to continuously monitor 
streamflow and water quality at multiple monitoring sites in 3 watersheds 
located in northern Utah.  The instruments report measurements in numerous datalogger 
data files that the researcher must now regularly retrieve, organize, 
quality-control/quality-check, aggregate, and manipulate before they can perform further analysis.  

"Make into a more elegant sentence"


1) Describe the entities and relationships that you have included in your data model
- Multiple Monitoring Sites
- 1 or More Time Series per Sensor
- Multiple Sensors at each Site
- 3 different watersheds


There are three watersheds in the network
- Logan, Provo, Red Butte

Each watershed contains multiple monitoring sites
- Aquatic, Climate, Storm Sewer

Each monitoring site implements multiple sensors
- Aquatic: Water Quality - ph, turbidity
- Climate: temperature, snow depth, precipitation

There are 1 or more time series per sensor 


Measurement of DO is 9.8
- Attribute could be the name of the measured variable, but if there are other
attributes that you would like to go into (like the value measured of DO, time,
etc) than it should be it's own entity
