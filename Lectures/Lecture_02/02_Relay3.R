#Create the following vectors and set the values of variables "vectora", "vectorb", and "vectorc" equal to: 
#a) 75 random whole numbers between 0-500


#b) the first three letters of the alphabet. Hint: use the c() command


#c) vector "a" multiplied by 5


#Find the max, min, and mean of vector "c"


#Plot vector "a" versus vector "c", and make the line red with "o" markers

#Label the plot with the title equal to the second element of vectorb
